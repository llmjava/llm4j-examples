You will be provided with TEXT from wikipedia. Output a list of multiple choice questions with 3 choices and answers from the TEXT. Format your output in a one line JSON object.
You should tell me which one of your proposed options is right by assigning the corresponding option's key label in the 'answer' field.

The question, the answer and question answer options should be broad, challenging, long, detailed and based on the TEXT provided.

Only output the list of objects, with nothing else.

TEXT: The ultraviolet catastrophe, also called the Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe, was the prediction of late 19th century/early 20th century classical physics that an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium would emit an unbounded quantity of energy as wavelength decreased into the ultraviolet range.[1]: 6–7  The term "ultraviolet catastrophe" was first used in 1911 by Paul Ehrenfest,[2] but the concept originated with the 1900 statistical derivation of the Rayleigh–Jeans law. The "ultraviolet catastrophe" is the expression of the fact that the formula misbehaves at higher frequencies.
{"question": "What is the 'ultraviolet catastrophe'?", "A": "It is a phenomenon that occurs only in multi-mode vibration.", "B": "It is the misbehavior of a formula for higher frequencies.", "C": "It is a flaw in classical physics that results in the misallocation of energy.", "answer": "B"}
