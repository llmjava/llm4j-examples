# Hugging Face Text Generation Inference API examples in Java

This code example illustrates how to use [hf_text_generation](https://github.com/llmjava/hf_text_generation) to query a Hugging Face Text Generation Inference API.

As an endpoint, you can use https://api-inference.huggingface.co or run the inference endpoint yourself (see how to setup [Text Generation Inference](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index)) and use that endpoint as your base URL.
